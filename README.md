# 🌐 Learn Front-End: Intro Project

Welcome to my second public front-end project!

This is a simple yet effective static page introducing the core pillars of front-end development: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I built it using only HTML and CSS to practice structuring content, styling elements, and writing clean code.

## 🚀 Why I built this

I'm still early in my journey as a front-end developer, and this project was a great opportunity to:

- Reinforce my understanding of HTML semantics and layout.
- Improve CSS skills, especially around styling sections and visual hierarchy.
- 💡 Use a **background image for the first time**, adding some visual flair to the hero section!

All the texts are in English and written in a casual tone — because learning doesn’t need to be boring. In future updates, I plan to add responsiveness and interactivity with JavaScript.

## 📚 What’s inside?

- 💡 Informal explanations for what HTML, CSS, and JS do.
- 🔗 External links to trusted documentation (W3Schools).
- 🎨 A bit of design experimentation using CSS backgrounds, shadows, and hover effects.

## 📌 Next steps

- Add a responsive layout (for mobile users).
- Build a dark/light theme toggle.
- Maybe turn this into a landing page template others can remix?
